# Marvel-Heroes Card Maker

Utilising two server side API, this application creates a Marvel Hero Card displayed on a HTML5 web browser with a thirty-second (30) soundtrack included. 


## User Story 
As a user, I want to be able to search for Marvel Heroes alphabetically, by comic name or by super hero name. So that I can make a card by clicking on the picture of a super hero and have a soundtrack displayed to me on the same card. 


## Acceptance Criteria 
This app meets the following criteria: 
- I am given three search criteria to search for super hero characters 
- When I click on the picture of a super hero, I am given the option to make a card from my selection 
- After I make my selection, my super hero card is displayed showing the character chosen and a soundtrack generated from the character chosen 
- On refresh of the web browser, I am shown all my previously made super hero cards.
